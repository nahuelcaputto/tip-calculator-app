## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Frontend build tool
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

This project was my second experience using **Vite** as a build tool, which enabled a fast development server, efficient hot module replacement, and a streamlined configuration workflow.

I worked extensively with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, reinforcing a component-based architecture and applying responsive, utility-first styling to closely match the intended design.

Finally, I implemented unit and component tests using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**, strengthening my understanding of testable component design, user-centric testing practices, and overall application reliability.
